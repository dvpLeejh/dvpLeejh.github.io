### Happy ARC Day üß©

We are excited to invite you to our **‚ÄúHappy ARC Day‚Äù**. This is our lab‚Äôs bi annual event where you have the unique opportunity to learn about our innovative research direction on abstraction and reasoning, and get to know [our members](https://sundong.kim/members/).

In this event you can understand more about this specific AI research that aims at solving the ARC IQ test. The **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus** (ARC) was introduced by Fran√ßois Chollet as a tool to measure broad intelligence in both humans and machines, the task is considered simple to the human mind but it can be difficult for the machines.

As it is a collaborative session, we will collectively explore AI/ML methodologies in handling few-shot and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets while solving ARC problems.

Join us for an afternoon of engaging discussions and hands-on problem-solving sessions. Our members will share their insights on the latest advancements in the field of abstraction and reasoning and make you engage in interactive sessions to come up with creative solutions to challenging IQ-test problems.

- Venue: TE (S7, 2F), GIST, Gwangju (This is an off-line event)
- Time: Aug 3 (Thu), 14:00 - 18:00 (dinner will be provided)
- Don‚Äôt forget to bring your laptop.

In addition to the learning opportunities, there will also be an interactive competition where you can first practice how to solve this ARC problem and after, compete with the other attendees to win prizes.

It is also a great chance for you to network and connect with like-minded individuals from the AI community. So come prepared to make new connections, exchange ideas, and have some fun!

Come and join us in shaping the future of AI! We look forward to seeing you there.
